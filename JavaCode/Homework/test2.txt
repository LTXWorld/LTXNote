It's
a
long
road.When
you
face
the
world
alone,
no
one
reaches
out
a
hand
for
you
to
hold.
Lord
knows
dreams
are
hard
to
follow,but
don't
let
anyone
tear
them
away.
Now
I
don't
need
your
wings
to
fly,
no,
I
don't
need
a
hand
to
hold
in
mine
this
time.
You
held
me
down
but
I
broke
free.
Now
I
don't
need
a
hero
to
survive,
cause
I
already
saved
my
life.
